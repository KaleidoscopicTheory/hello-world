# hello-world
The beginning of an artistic exploration in processing between geomerative and hype for a Septemebr exhibition, 2017.
I am a High School Art and Technology teacher. I was introduced to Creative coding in 2015 and am keen to follow in to footsteps of the likes of Joshua Davis. I want to teach my students to create generative programs and lead by example by walking the talk and exhibiting such work myself.
